# To do:
###  Communication with Back-end
The class is created but is pending a real backend to test it against. More specifically:
- Need to check that the payload can be added 
- Need to update the database with results
- Need to handle network errors

### Add a splash screen and explanations about Shippy

### Change theme of the app

### Add user registration screen (with picture & ID)
### Add a button for "booking a person"
### Add notification of booking
### Add a screen for security measures
### Refactor the "offer" detail page
### Wrap every activity change and fragment change by a "try - catch" block
### Add a feedback button via WhatsApp or email -- or check integration with freshdesk
### Be careful that distances between the sender and the postman should be calculated between streets and not between cities
### If search returns no result, suggest to invite friends.
